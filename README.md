### Basic Registrator in C++

#### You are able to register a username and password and login to your account. There are regex filters for both username and passwords to meet certain conditions. The inputs are then put into a txt file to be stored. There are also functions to check if the username was already taken and if a user forgot their password, they can enter their username to search for the password.

### What I Learned
#### File manipulation in C++
#### Regex Filters in C++

### To-Do-Next
#### In the next database program, I want to learn to use an actual SqlDB instead of a .txt file.
